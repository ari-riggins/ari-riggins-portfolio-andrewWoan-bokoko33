The polygons are divided first into trapezoids by first adding vertical edges from the reflex vertices and from there are divided into monotone polygons. These are much easier to triangulate.</p>

Then all of the rectangles compiled from the triangles making up the polygon are stacked together to create one large rectangle of consistent width. This process is completed for both polygons and when the resulting rectangles are the same, the algorithm is demonstrated.</p>
